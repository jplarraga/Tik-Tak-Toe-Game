# Tik-Tak-Toe-Game
Tik-Tak-Toe game created with React components and JS logic.

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is a simple tik-tak-toe game created with React components and js logic to manage the states of each one of this components. The styling is made with CSS but it is passed to each of the components displayed on the HTML through the className properties.</p>

<h2>Instalation</h2>

  <li>Copy the code of the repository</li>
  <li>On your terminal locate the folder in which you would like to take the files and then press: <strong> git clone </strong> and then paste the code copied on the repository</li>
  <li>Once the files are cloned to the local file, in your terminal write <strong>code .</strong>. this will eventually open VSCode </li>
  <li>Work on the website and apply all the changes needed and when the progress is considerable write in the terminal <strong> git add .</strong> this will appply all the changes</li>
  <li>Write <strong> git commit -m (any text with the changes made) </strong> this will commit all the changes made so far</li>
  <li>Whenever the code is ready to upload it to the repository write <strong>git push origin master</strong>. If it is not the master repository then the code to write is <strong>git push origin main</strong> this is the location of the main branch.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Further than the game itself, this project is intended to strengthen the capacity to use React components and how they relate to their child components and how they can pass the properties information among them. It also is intended to show how the logic of mounting and unmounting components and some conditional styling</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>As this game was intended to showcase the functionality of React components I could say that we could implement two different aspects of the game. The first one is related to ask who is going to play against whom and at the same time each player could have the opportunity to choose whether they can be X or O and then using mounting and unmounting to display the board with the information of each player. The second component I would definetely create is a buttom that resets the game since the only option for this is to refresh the page from the browser. This buttom could only be shown once there is a winner declared. In this case I could make use of the conditional ternary operator to display this button.
